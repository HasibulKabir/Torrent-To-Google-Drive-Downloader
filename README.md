## This notebook is completely useless
After releasing notebook, I just realized this notebook is completely useless because you know we can select which files to download so I don't have to download the whole thing also these days most of the torrent clients have media players so this program is completely useless but I'm going to keep it on my Github because the source code is might be useful for somebody.

### Tutorial
Click the badge which says 'Open in Colab' and follow directions there.

### What is the purpose of it?
1. Because of Google Servers speed, I downloaded 12GB of file and the average speed was 60MBPS.
2. Because it is in the cloud, by that I mean I can access it anywhere on my phone, tablet or etc without copying file to all of them.
